# -password-security-checking
I created multiple passwords with different complexity using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and lengths. Tested them in a password strength checker, noted scores and feedback. Learned best practices and common attacks like brute force &amp; dictionary. Finally summarized how strong passwords improve security.
